# deepseekr1-playground
Running DeepSeek R1 locally to play around with it. I did this using a Mac.  


My Steps (Thank you Rohan Paul, Twitter: @rohanpaul_ai):

1. Downloaded Ollama
2. The following DeepSeek-r1 models are available thru ollama, run whichever you prefer and think will be able to run locally on your machine:
1.5B version (smallest):
ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b

8B version:
ollama run deepseek-r1:8b

14B version:
ollama run deepseek-r1:14b

32B version:
ollama run deepseek-r1:32b

70B version (biggest/smartest):
ollama run deepseek-r1:70b

The larger they are --> need more GPU power. I followed the suggestion of starting with deepseek-r1:8b. Running the appropriate command on my terminal allows for local usage. 
3. As per Rohan's suggestion, I downloaded an AI chatbot application for a better (or more aesthetically pleasing) user experience. I used Rohan's own application: https://chatboxai.app
  1. I chose to use his because it is privacy focused, stores all your data locallyâ€”from conversation histories to personal settings. Everything stays on your device, giving you full control.
